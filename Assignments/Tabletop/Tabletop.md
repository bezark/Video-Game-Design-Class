### Assignment Prompt: Tabletop Group Project

#### Objective:
Design and create a tabletop game that can be played within the classroom environment. The game should be engaging, clear in its objectives and rules, and designed to be completed within a 15-minute timeframe.

#### Constraints:
- **Classroom Play:** The game must be suitable for playing inside the classroom. Consider the physical space and resources available.
- **Duration:** The game should not exceed 15 minutes in total playtime.
- **Clear Objective:** Your game must have a well-defined objective that players strive to achieve.
- **Rule-set:** Develop a clear and concise set of rules that govern gameplay. The rules should be easy to understand and follow.

#### Submission Requirements:
- **Game Prototype:** Bring in a physical prototype of your game. This can be a simple, hand-made version using everyday materials. Conduct a playtest in class on the day of the deadline.
- **Ruleset:** Submit a written set of rules for your game. The ruleset should explain the objective, gameplay, and any other necessary information for players. Plaintext or Markdown files are preferred.

#### Grading Criteria: (Total 16 Points)
- **Clarity and Completeness of Rules (0-4 points):** Evaluated based on how clear, understandable, and easily accessible the rules are for new players. Are the rules sufficient enough to create a complete game-play experience?
- **Meeting Design Goals (0-4 points):** Assessed on how well your game meets the your own stated design goals. Do the mechanics create the aesthetic experience you were going for?
- **Working within Constraints (0-4 points):** Points awarded for effectively working within the given constraints (classroom suitability, duration, and rule clarity).
- **Polish and Theme(0-4 points ):** Awarded for making your prototype look pretty and giving it an interesting narrative theme.

#### Tips for Success:
- **Test Your Game:** Ensure that your game can be played to completion within the 15-minute limit. Internal playtesting is crucial.
- **Focus on Clarity:** Make your rules as clear as possible. A well-designed game is easy to pick up and play.
- **Be Creative:** Use your creativity within the constraints to make the game engaging and fun.
- **Reflect on Design Principles:** Consider the game design principles discussed in class and how they apply to your project. Think about your desired aesthetic outcome, then work backwards to imagine mechanics that support it.
