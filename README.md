- **Instructor:** John Bezark
- **Office Hours:** Thursday 1-5pm. [Book here](https://bit.ly/bezark-office-hours)


## **Course Description:**
An introductory course exploring the fundamentals of digital game design and development. This course will use Godot 4 as the primary game creation tool, and it wil cover the basics of game development, coding fundamentals, and game design principles. Students will engage in hands-on projects to develop practical skills in both 2D and 3D game design. Students are not expected to have any prior programming or game design experience.

## **Course Objectives:**
- Understand the principles of game design and development.
- Gain proficiency in Godot 4.
- Develop basic coding skills relevant to game design.
- Complete three major game design projects: a tabletop game, a 2D game, and a capstone game.
- Enhance writing and oral presentation skills through game-related assignments.
- Be able to better work in teams
- Respond to critical feedback constructively

# **Assessment**
