### 2D Game Design Brainstorming Activity

**Objective:** To generate viable, creative ideas for 2D games that can be developed using Godot 4, focusing on originality, feasibility, and alignment with course objectives.

**Materials Needed:**
- Sticky notes (multiple colors)
- Markers
- Whiteboard or large poster boards
- Timer

**Group Setup:** Divide the class into their project groups. Each group should have a mix of roles (e.g., programmer, artist, designer, writer).

**Activity Outline:**

1. **Warm-Up (5 minutes):**
   - Quick round-robin in each group, where each member shares their favorite 2D game and what they love about it. This warms up the creative thinking and gets everyone talking.

2. **Idea Generation Phase (10 minutes):**
   - **Round 1 (5 minutes):** Each student writes down one game idea on a sticky note. Encourage wild, broad thinking â€“ no idea is too out there. Use different colored sticky notes for different elements like game mechanics, themes, or narratives.
   - **Round 2 (5 minutes):** Students pass their sticky notes to the right. Each student then adds to or modifies the idea they received, expanding on the concept or adding a new element.

3. **Idea Sharing & Refinement (10 minutes):**
   - Each group sticks their notes onto a whiteboard or poster board, clustering similar ideas together.
   - Groups discuss the ideas, combining and refining them. The goal is to identify 2-3 potential concepts that excite the team.
   - Use markers to draw connections between related ideas or themes that emerge, fostering a discussion on how these could translate into game mechanics or narratives.

4. **Pitch & Feedback (5 minutes):**
   - Each group quickly pitches their top idea(s) to another group, who provides constructive feedback focusing on originality, feasibility given the course constraints, and potential for development.
   - After receiving feedback, groups have a brief discussion to select their final idea or to combine elements from their top concepts into one.

**Wrap-Up:**
- Conclude the activity with each group briefly sharing their chosen idea with the class. This fosters a sense of community and opens up for initial impressions and encouragement from peers and the instructor.

**Note for Instructor:**
- Facilitate the activity by keeping time, encouraging participation, and guiding the groups to think critically about their ideas in terms of feasibility, scope, and how they can leverage the capabilities of Godot 4.
- Emphasize the importance of each role in game development and how diverse perspectives can contribute to a richer game concept.
